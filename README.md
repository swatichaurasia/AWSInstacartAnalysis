# AWSInstacartAnalysis
Instacart orders data was taken from Kaggle and analysis was done using AWS services such as S3, athena and quicksight. There were total five datasets and i have considered four of them for the analysis purpose. The following steps were taken :
Firstly data was uploaded in S3 bucket, which acts as a storage service.
After that we analyse data using Amazon Athena which provides us service to run sql queries to analyze data as desired.
Lastly, we can use quicksight for visualisation of data and see various types of charts and plots.
